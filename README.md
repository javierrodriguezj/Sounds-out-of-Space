# Sounds out of Space.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

Sounds out of Space (SooS) is currently being developed. SooS is a bot that will post a video (everyday at 12.00h (CET) on [Valencian physics student local section's account](https://x.com/EstRSEF_UV)) of the galactic object which Hubble photographed each day of the year. The video will contain a *song* that describes Hubble's picture.

This project was born in NASA's Hackathon (NASA Space Apps Challenge) to face the challenge called: *'Symphony of the Stars: Harmonizing the James Webb Space Telescope in Music and Images'*. Our team was formed by physics students which belong to the Valencian physics students local section
